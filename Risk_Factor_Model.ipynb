    "The sheet labeled \"Target\" contains a time series vector that we would like to explain, and the “factors” and/or “etf-returns” sheets are potential risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach is to fit a multiple linear regression of the etfs, factors, or both the etfs and factors to the return series. The models' variables (etfs and/or factors) serve as the factors in the factor model, and the coefficients to these factors serve as a proxy to the proportion that each one of those factors plays in modeling the variance."

    "Upon opening up the excel document, we notice that there is a date mismatch. It is not unheard of to have an extended time series, i.e. of a greater length for the predictors or independent variables, and a shorter time series for your response variable (or dependent variable). This is typically done when trying to use a historical period of time to compute one or more statistics that are relevant to the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in this data set, the response had a larger vector length, starting from 2010, while the independent variables had data only from 2018 onward. This is unusual. It could be caused for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the data was provided by an external data provider \"as-is.\" Perhaps the data was generated by querying a table, and the date ranges weren't aligned. Regardless, we need to figure out what to do here. One option is to go out and find data for 2010-2018 for the predictors, and then prepend that to the given data. However, this could result in issues if different data providers submit their own, differing quotes. For exchange data this doesn't happen, but I am less familiar with macroeconomic data. Thus, I will restrict the data analysis period to 2018 to 2020.\n",
